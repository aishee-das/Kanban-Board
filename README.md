# Kanban Board
This repository contains Kanban Board built by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To use, the Kanban board simply open https://aishee-das.github.io/Kanban-Board/.

<h2>Usage</h2>
To use the Kanban Board, simply follow these steps:
 <ul>1. Click on the "Add Item" at the bottom of any column to create a task.</ul>
 <ul>2. Fill in the task name.</ul>
 <ul>3. To move a task, to a different column, simpley drag and drop to the desired column.</ul>
 <ul>4. To delete a task, click on the item you want to delete and remove the task.</ul>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
In the future, I had like to add a feature that lets you delete an item just by clicking on the "Delete" button. I had also like an option that can let you edit existing tasks.
